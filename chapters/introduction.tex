\chapter{Introduction}
This is a language with all of the things in it that we like. Here's a list of
things we like that are in this language:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Proto-Uralic and its descendants
  \item Feeling like we're foxes
  \item Feeling like Siberia never got colonized by the Russians or invaded by
    the Mongols
  \item Yukaghir and Eskimo-Aleut loanwords
  \item Loanwords from famous literary and scientific languages for science
    stuff
  \item Loanwords from words we know (mainly Hungarian and English ones) for
    modern stuff
  \item Senary
  \item Austronesian alignment
  \item Not having to use case markers
  \item Case markers
  \item Octal
  \item Derivational morphology
  \item Uvular phonemes
  \item Evidentials
  \item Not marking tense but having endless aspects
  \item Moods but actually it's more derivational morphology
  \item Decimal
  \item Hundreds of pronouns
  \item Not having to distinguish number
  \item Phonologies with small syllables
  \item Vowel harmony
  \item Phonemic vowel length
  \item Phonemic nasalization, but we only like it a little so it's rare
  \item Mixed-base hexadecimal/base-64
  \item Using the same construction for adjectives, participles, and relative
    clauses
  \item Verb serialization
  \item Conlanging
\end{itemize}
Here's a list of things we like that are \emph{not} in this language:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Syllabic consonants
  \item Tones
  \item /\upa{Ã¸}/
  \item Overlong vowels and consonants
  \item Interesting letters and diacritics
  \item Weird number systems, such as p-adic or bijective ones
  \item Particles used for syntax
  \item Free word order
  \item A practical, unique writing system (it seperately has a practical one
    and a unique one)
\end{itemize}
It's good and fun. We'll probably use this for journal entries and poetry.
