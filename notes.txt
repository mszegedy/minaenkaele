          LUOBBAL SÁMMOL ÁNTE'S PU
        AND ITS RELATION TO MINÄNKÄLE

         notes by idiots, for idiots


phono clarifications:
  ć    alveolo-palatal affric
  ś    (fric allophone of ć in codas)
  č    postalveolar affric
  š    postalveolar fric
  d    dental approx
  đ    palatalized dental approx
  g    velar approx/voiced fric
  ń    alveolo-palatal nasal
  ä    /æ/
  ë    /ɤ/
  ü    /y/
  e    /e/, but in non-initial syllables /ə/

— word-initial d, g, ŋ, and r didn't occur,
  though indo-iranian loans like repä-će could
  start with r
— -jn was a thing apparently from possessor
  suffixes
— -w stems were too (-wə- medially)
— č, š, ń, d, đ, and g haven't occurred in any
  suffix; i think ń deserves to be in a suffix,
  but the rest can go (alveolars and voiced
  central approximants)
— -jCC- and -sn- occurred, but only across
   morpheme boundaries; there are other clusters
   like that, but there's no pattern between them
— ə-stems elided the final vowel and were used
  as CV(C)C- stems. to avoid -CCC- they did
  things like:
    — n > ∅ /_CC (manče-ta > mačta)
    — k > ∅ /C_C (kulke-ta > kulta)
  and maybe:
    — p > ∅ /_CC (lëpće-ta > lëśta)
  which assimilations DON'T occur is not
  covered. the following can be reconstructed
  from the possessor suffixes:
    — N₁N₂ > N₁ (always?)
— there were words that were both verbs and
  nouns, seemingly always
    [do thing : product of thing]
  e.g. kuńće, kuse, ćülke, ćoje, wuwa 'flow'.
— adjectives were just nouns meaning "thing that
  is [adjective]"; the most obvious ones are:
    wuđe    'new'
    küse    'thick'
    pid-ka  'long, high'
    ëńa     'tame'
  some suffixes made adjectives:
    ŋa ji   'PROP'
    gta-ma  'CAR-GER?'
    mta     'ORD' (with numbers)
— there's only a small number of canonical space
  words:
    üle   'on, above'
    ëla   'under, below'
    ede   'in front of'
    taka  'behind on the other side of'
    läse  'near or opposite to'
    müŋgä 'behind your back'
  üle became finnic external -l-. internal -s-
  is more obscure; may have meant 'opening'. the
  following nouns turned into space words:
    peŋä 'end'
    mëge 'earth'
    tüŋe 'base'
    muka 'back of creature'
  and the following compound:
    men-tä-lä 'go-CAUS-NOMZ'
      > 'along, through, past, during'
— personal pronouns (w/ mk glosses):
    minä  me    1-3₁  1
    tinä  te    2-3₁  2
    nä          3₁
    sä    se    3ₙ₁   3
  other pronouns:
    tä     'this'
    to/tu  'that'
    mi     'what'
    ke     'who'
    ku     'why, where, when, how, etc.'
— aux verbs:
    e      'NEG'
    e-lä   'NEG:IMP'
    wole   'be, live, dwell'
    lewe   'give birth? breathe? become?'
— cases:
    ∅  m  n  NOM ACC GEN
    na ta ŋ  LOC ABL LAT
    k        NOM         -DU
    t  j  j  NOM ACC GEN -PL
  idk:
    kse   TRANS? DEST?
    gta-k ABESS-? (doesn't seem like a case)
— possession (with mk glosses):
    NOM  ACC   GEN
    me   me    ne      1
    te   mte   nte     2
    ne   me    ne      3₁
    sa   msa   nsa     3ₙ₁

    men  men   nen     1  -3₁
    ten  mten  nten    2  -3₁
    san  msan  nsan    3ₙ₁-3₁

    mat  mat   nat     1-PL
    tat  mtat  ntat    2-PL
    sat  msat  nsat    3-PL
— tense:
    k    PRES? PFV?
    ć    PAST? TEL?
    j    PAST? PERF? IPFV? ATEL?
— mood:
    k     IMP and also for some reason CONNEG
    ne?   some irrealis thing
— person (on verbs, with mk glosses):
  indefinite:
    m  men  mat    1    1  -3₁  1-PL
    t  ten  tat    2    2  -3₁  2-PL
    n              3₁
    ∅  kan  ∅-t    3ₙ₁  3ₙ₁-3₁  3-PL
  definite:
    lol just use the possessor suffixes
— deverbal nouns:
    ma            NMZ
    w             NMZ
    pa            PART.ACT

    ma-gta-ma     PART.NEG
    ma-k-ta-ma    (alternate of above)
— denominal nouns:
    ka            no idea lol
    kka           lmaoooooooo idk
    kće           RECP?
    ńća           COLL.ANIM
    kse           VIALIS basically?
    we-kse        makes space words concrete?
    ŋa            PROP.INAL
    je            PROP.AL
    gta-ma        ABESS-NMZ
    m-pa          COMP or MODV
    mta           ORD (with numbers)
— denominal verbs:
    ta            VBZ
    je            VBZ
    le            VBZ
    me            INCH <3
    m-ta          INCH-CAUS <3 <3 <3 <3
    m-ta-w        INCH-CAUS-REFL?
    w             idk lol
— deverbal verbs:
    ta            CAUS
    p-ta          ICPV-CAUS?
    k-ta          PFV-CAUS?
    w             REFL?
    le            some duration thing
    l-ta          nooooooooo idea haha
    nte           FREQ (stative?)
    kće           FREQ (active?)
    je            might add volition :o
— compounds were basically always bipartite, and
  thing₁=thing₂ > [thing that has thing₁ and
  thing₂ as important parts] is particularly
  common.
    nose=mouth > face
  and
    father=mother > parents
  are examples of this, and
    knee=bone > knee, neck=bone > neck
  are too (morphemic expansion?).
— pre-pu could have been split-erg, but there's
  no evidence pu was.
— NOM objects were a thing; mk will represent
  this as noun incorporation, because obviously.
— insofar as adjectives were a thing at all,
  ADJ NOUN was the order for that. we're just
  gonna lump these in with compounds, and treat
  them as [classifier]=[thing] compounds.
— postpositions didn't real; it was
    word-GEN space_word(-LAT/LOC/ABL)
  all along. just as everyone has suspected since
  forever.
— negation was e-[morpho] [verb]-k. (or elä if
  it was an imperative; who tf knows what the
  lä was for. you can't mix it up with 'live',
  because that takes, like, actual predicates,
  not connegatives.)
— stuff like "it's raining" was 3SG apparently.
  or just -∅, i mean that's not really special
— there were no conjunctions and relative
  pronouns; somehow everything was done with
  verbal nouns. this didn't make much sense when
  we read it in raun 1988, and sure as fuck
  doesn't make more sense now. there has to be
  a way to glue them together, and compounds
  don't cut it. so, wtf?
— see aikio 2002 and 2006 for juicy new samoyedic
  roots (pystynen has them on his blog i think).
— vocabwise, pu seems to have:
    — about 120 stems relating to bodies and
      minds. there's rich vocab for things you
      can do with your mouth <3:
        sewe  'eat'      soske  'chew'
        jürä  'gnaw'     jëge   'drink'
        ńime  'suck'     ńale   'lick'
        ńäle  'swallow'  pala   'eat up'
        appa  'devour'   puwa   'blow'
        ćülke 'spit'     pure   'bite'
    — about 100 basic verbs
    — about 120 environment words, incl:
        päjwä 'day'      eje    'night'
        kaja  'sun'      sükeće 'autumn'
        tälwä 'winter'   ëde    'year'
        wete  'water'    lume   'snow'
        jäŋge 'ice'      tuwe   'lake'
        lupsa 'dew'      künte  'fog'
        ćada  'rain'     purke  'snowstorm'
    — like ten kinship words but they're all for
      in-laws
    — about 50 words for tech (not including that
      famous finnic root for "carbon monoxide")
    — a word for a soul representing your body,
      and also a word for a soul representing
      your conscious mind, which later got
      grammaticalized as a reflexive pronoun in
      like half of all uralic languages. also,
      the verb for when birds court each other
      also meant "sing a shamanic song", which
      aikio thinks probably means that the
      ancient uralians got high on shrooms and
      had sex a lot (for spiritual reasons ofc).
      i will note that we would have had vastly
      better mental healthcare in prehistoric
      yugra than we've had in the modern united
      states, apparently. the word for shrooms
      was pëŋka, loaned from indo-iranian for
      "hemp".
    — aikio reconstructs these numerals:
        1 ükti  / äkti
        2 kVkta / kVktä
        3 kolme / kurme
        4 neljä
        5 wijte / wijete / wijtte / wijette
        6 kuwte / kuwVte / kuwtte / kuwVtte
        7 śäććemä (note ś-; def an ie loanword)
      khanty and hungarian had *eđe for 1, and
      no one knows why.
      there's also luka '10' and śëta '100', but
      the first one has only like three reflexes
      and the second one's an indo-iranian loan.
    — check out bergsland 1959 and seefloth 2000
      for actually good uraleut comparisons. some
      cool possible cognates:
        ëla  'below'    pe  atə   'down'
                        alt ac    'bottom &c'
                        pe  alaq  'sole'
        elä  'live'     pe  ətə   'be'
        tule 'come'     pe  tut   'arrive'
                        pe  tulag 'land (v)'
                        alt cala  'land (v)'
        kuda 'dawn'     pe  qilag 'sky'
                        alt qilax 'dawn'
        kuda 'weave'    pe  qilag 'knit, weave'

      THANKS FOR SCROLLING TO THE BOTTOM <3
