\chapter{Introduction}
This is a language with all of the things in it that we like. Here's a list of
things we like that are in this language:
\begin{itemize}
  \item A serious reconstruction of Proto-Uralic
  \item Feeling like we're foxes
  \item Feeling like Siberia never got colonized by the Russians or invaded by
    the Mongols
  \item Yukaghir things
  \item Loanwords from famous literary and scientific languages for science
    stuff
  \item Loanwords from words we know (mainly Hungarian and English ones) for
    modern stuff
  \item Senary
  \item Noun incorporation
  \item Not having to use case markers
  \item Case markers
  \item Octal
  \item Derivational morphology
  \item Evidentials
  \item Not marking tense but having endless aspects
  \item Maybe-realis and irrealis moods
  \item More moods but actually it's more derivational morphology
  \item Decimal
  \item Not having to distinguish number
  \item Having to distinguish affiliation
  \item Phonologies with small syllables
  \item Vowel harmony
  \item Mixed-base hexadecimal/base-64
  \item Not using any conjunctions or relativizers
  \item Free word order
  \item Verb serialization
  \item Conlanging
\end{itemize}
Here's a list of things we like that are \emph{not} in this language:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Austronesian alignment (our noun incorporation system approximates it)
  \item Syllabic consonants
  \item Tones
  \item /\upa{Ã¸}/
  \item Phonemic length
  \item Weird number systems, such as p-adic or bijective ones
  \item Particles used for syntax
  \item A practical, unique writing system (it seperately has a practical one
    and a unique one)
\end{itemize}
It's good and fun. We'll probably use this for journal entries and poetry.
